# 37

Since we got the vaccine it's been bitterly cold.
The house too cavernous, the fireplace too dangerous, we huddled under blankets in sweatshirts and thermals throughout your second trimester.

And you looked sublime.
You got round at the end of your first third, and goofier and rosier and sleepier.
The house took on an air of hibernation and even Nora calmed as you expanded and she anticipated.
We all thought magical thoughts together.

And yet, there was an occasional air of dissatisfaction about you in your more lucid hours.
Some sub-clinical depression that put a frown on your face whenever you happened to notice the sock on the couch, the mismatched curtains, the shabbiness of the table, the crowded laundry would drive you to irritation and bed.
Sometimes you could be cheered, once or twice you remained sullen for hours.

I tried, ever more patiently and consistently I'd like to believe, to be a good husband.
But your dissatisfaction loitered beneath the surface and seemed to find its root with me.
I cooked more, cleaned more, bathed Nora, but I felt (perhaps unjustifiably) that there was always a next thing or job that you needed from me before you felt like I had earned your favor or that you could admit I had.
Much of that feeling stemmed from the fact that, despite our relative harmony, you hadn't touched or kissed me in a sexual way almost since we moved in.

A biased portrait, I'll concede. 
And there's a fair amount of mind reading (how else can we interpret each other).
Other days you were happier than I've seen you in years.
You were more affectionate, enthusiastic about games with Nora and I, and yielding with the TV.
One day we lay on the couch all afternoon watching Planet Earth, like stoners, answering questions, laughing goofily, caressing each other's hands and feet.

Eternal questions are inevitably cliche.
What is it you want? 
And what could I do to realize that? 
I've pondered it often over the last decade, almost daily over the last year as our relationship felt to me somehow tighter yet more mysterious, improving but impenetrable, inscrutable like a cat on your lap.
And now that our collective biological imperative seems all but assured, and the big purchase has weathered the bulk of the winter, we are a belated but earnest American dream, my drive to impose myself has diminished.
You could call it ego, if you want to reduce me to a pencil chiaroscuro profile, it's as hormonal as it is psychological.
I look at you, round and rosy and morose and morose, giggly, stern, peaceful, and in your three dimensionality I find my own width is reflected.

Partially.
The subject of desire as always felt one-sided and unempathetic in our relationship.
You've expressed a dissonance felt at the juxtaposition of your roles as mother and wife.
But I cannot understand a contradiction that appears to me as sensible as the tritest tautologies: A is A, 2+2=4, etc.
Our fecundity strikes an atavistic chord with me that I feel compelled to worship with my body as my deepest source of transcendence and what I am most grateful for in life.
It's difficult to open like a sophomore philosophy major with the meaning of life so I sought to express myself cautiously and focus on the superficial aspects of our intimate life this winter.
I tried to remind myself of all I had to feel grateful for and attend to the joy of a pregnant wife, a growing healthy daughter, a stable job and a patch of land.
And that worked, but I was aware that in a way I was simply repressing my dissatisfaction, wondering how long I could feel hopeless about this aspect of my life.

I mentioned something to you in passing two weeks ago.
Lazy, platonic in bed I was trying to get at something I didn't understand.

"Remember when we moved in?"

"I can't believe it's been 6 months."

"Back in October I said to Carolyn how I liked giving you control over the moving.  Doing what you said wasn't 'that bad'."

"I wouldn't think it would be if you respected me. I don't really believe you."
Derailing intimacy with cynicism, I'm familiar with this pattern.
I wonder if I'll ever really understand why.

"Oof!" We hesitate.

"It's actually something I really like about you. It drew me to you initially."

"Hmm."

"Yeah I mean you seemed to want the ball. Sometimes you do now, but not as much."
I kinda trailed off.

"Hmm."  
You screwed up your face a little, but, as I pondered what changed, you decided to move on.
"Actually, it's something I liked about you too and then didn't and now kinda do again. You're not into anything but ideas. You'll go along with whatever outside of that."

Sometimes I live with something I want to say that won't go away in my head for months.
Sometimes I just say it.
On my back I turned my head to you.
"I'm afraid to say it because I think you won't like it or it taints a moment by reducing it to an ulterior motive, but I want you so badly even though you're pregnant and I now you don't want sex, but I very very much do."

I said that very fast.
You stayed silent for at least 15 seconds.

"And I love you and want you to be happy."

"But you want to fuck me when I won't want to?"

I sighed and gazed heavenward.
"I can't help it. I want you like a plug wants a socket."

"Any socket?"

I turned my head back to you. "Fair. Ok. Like an eyeball wants a socket."

"Hmm." You half chuckle not looking at me.

You took a minute to process.
"So you're saying that you want to fuck me uncomfortable and bloated."

"Yes absolutely. Among other things. That's kind of a narrow perspective."

"Hmm. Are you hard now?"
With rare curiosity.

"Yes."

"Really?"

"Yep."
Hopeful, I imagined you would want to confirm my assertion.

"Hmm." 
And then, after a minute. 
Help me up.""

I got up and stood in profile so you could see my erection tenting my pajamas.
I offered you my hand and you got up, held onto my hand as you walked past, slipped from my grasp and paused int he doorway.

"Ok, but you have to trust me."

"Ok."

"And don't bug me."

"Ok."

You went to the bathroom and I laid on the bed for 10 minutes wondering and erect, simmering and chaste.

## ---------------------------------------------------------

Today it's Tuesday. 
Nora's at school and I'm playing hooky taking a shower downstairs.
I'm preoccupied with questions of errors and bugs and compilers and wandering the paths from library to linker at compile and runtime.
Shampoo in my hair staring blank and internal at the fake subway time and I hear the pocket door scratch and squeak.
Could it be what I hope?
No, I'm primed to shelve my dreams.
She's coming to ask a question or go to the bathroom or grab a razor.

The curtain slides and you're there nude and pregnant and perfect.

"Hi."
You say with a flat expression and step in. 
I move back half a step reflexively; the stream is between us.

"Hi. You l--" 

You reach out and grab my expanding penis by the shaft handshake firm as you step into the stream.

"Ok, ok." 
You cut me off. 
You use your right hand to nudge the dial toward cold.
"Pass me the soap."
I oblige as if this happened every day.
You take it keeping your left hand on my now almost completely solid cock.
You start to squeeze me lightly like a stress ball.
I'm staring at your nipples and loving the soft curve of the weight of your breasts on your round fertile stomach.

A momentary reverie. 
Your eyes move up to meet mine.
Our gaze locks and you move your hand up my stomach to scratch lightly at the hair on my sternum.
You turn toward me and now my rock hard member slides along the upper contour of your expectant belly.
You hold my eyes, and I sense a faint smile.
Perhaps my wide eyed joy and awe are becoming too much for you, and I can't blame you as you crowd me, put return the soap to the tray and in a loud whisper, "Close your eyes."
And I do.

You take my left hand and guide it to your right breast.
"Don't squeeze, gentle like this."
You stroke your bosom with my hand.
I continue as you turn and bend over to wet your hair.
"Mmm hmm. Just like that."
As if I had struck the right position in a yoga studio.
You've let go of me but you press yourself up against me as you condition your hair.

I sneak a peek with one eye.

"Don't open your eyes or I'm out."

"Yes, wi--"

"Shhhh."

I get it, and you know you don't need to explain.
You scratch my chest again and tiptoe to give me a peck on the lips.
Gather some conditioner from your head and grab my dick hard enough to elicit a little gasp.
My mouth stuck open and mute.
You begin stroking it up and down rhythmically with one hand, cradling, rubbing, gently squeezing my scrotum with the other.
Rubbing the tip against the underside of your bump.

The shower stream drones percussive on the curtain.
You lead me around the contours of my desire, the bouncy house landscape of my parasympathetic nervous system, fluctuating stimulation surrounding the point of release.
I alternate between our shower and a private reverie recalling the moment within you, surrounded by you, embraced by you, we started someone new.

The shower beats thick on our legs and hips.
I'm throbbing between your hands, you're pulling my shaft toward you slowly hand over hand my tip poking the front of your belly.

"Do, you like that?"

"Mmm." 
Assenting.

"Good." 
You squeese me hard.

"Mmm. Ooh."

"That?"

"Yes wi--"

"Shhh. No words."
Squeezing me like a blood pressure bulb.

"Tell me when you're about to cum.  Say 'aah' when you're about to."

I nod.

You step back and stroke me harder and faster.

A minute later. "Aah."

You suddenly let go.
I'm still as a statue, and I can hear you rinsing your hair.
You grab me again half a minute later with a handful of conditioner and slick you stroke my dick intensely.
You cup my balls with your other hand and rub my tip on your stomach around your belly button.

A minute later I moan. "Mmm. Aah."

You let go and press my dick against your bump. Rubbing me firmly against the top of your belly with your hand.

"Aah."  I'm close and you stop moving but squeeze me against the top of your belly.

"You wanna cum on my tits?"

"Yuh huh."

"Say it."

"Yes."

"Say it all."

"Yes. I want to cum on your tits, Amanda"

"Please."

"Please, let me cum on your tits, Amanda!"
I'm yelling.
I'm beside myself with passion.

And you let go. 
I'm throbbing in space buffeted by shower drops, undrained.

The curtain slides, a towel, footsteps.

I step forward, eyes shut tight and put my hand on the sink outside the shower. 
The pocket door squeaks and scratches.

"Hey." 
I start with nowhere to go.

"You can open your eyes."

I see you there in the doorway with a towel and the hint of a grin.
I'm agog.

"In fifteen minutes come to the couch and rub my feet. You can finish yourself off if you want."
You say matter of factly and turn to walk away.

"Should I finish?" 
I ask amazed.

"If you want."
You repeat more slowly.

"I want," more slowly, "to do what you want me to do."

You appraise for a second or two.
You're almost surprised but completely composed.
<!--Gaze briefly at my solid dick pointing at you, ready, invasive, thirsty. -->

"No."

You went and I finished my shower.

### A note on the text

Did you know, and I think about this often, that I really want to be a "Yes wife" kind of husband?
And I've been thinking about how we could reconfigure our relationship to make that easier.

There's nothing I want more than to please you, but it always feels like there's an impediment.
So it's essential that we make a better definition of success and strive for it. -->
