Tuesday morning. a relatively cool midsummer day. 
You told me to take off work. 
I asked why, you told me not to ask.

Yesterday you dropped Nora and Lewis off at camp. It's Lewis' first year. 
You roused me and handed me my medicine at the usual time. 
In my torpor I fantasized that you would slip back in bed, nude and grinning. 
I walked the curves and arrows of your body as I do when I recall my sincerest contentment. 
The word 'wife' quotation marks, like a mantra, hangs silent and pregnant on my lips. 
I conjure your smell in memory, being alive is yes.

I fade out and into our room. Bright blue wall behind your mother's dresser. 
I feel a pang of disappointment you haven't joined me. It fades instantly. 
I smell bacon in cast iron.

Wander stiffly to the kitchen, I'm surprised.
A big bowl of scrambled eggs on the table and you standing there lifting bacon onto a paper towel covered plate in a pink silk nightgown you've only worn three times, hair up in a ponytail.
Your bare arms, girlish and limber and faintly muscular, lift the pan into the sink where it hisses.

'Perfect timing', you say brightly.

I smile, 'Mmm Hmm.'  I pour myself a cup of coffee and take a seat.

'What's your pla-', I start to ask plating a spoonful of eggs.

'SHHHH', you reply.

We eat in comfortable relaxed silence.
I can't remember the last time we were alone, together, at home, in the morning.
I start to ask if you can, and you shoot me a quick admonishing glance.
Too beautiful to resist, I sip my coffee.

Finished, I lean back.

'Brush', you request as you clear the plates.

'Of course', I reply, delighted. It is a statement of intent.

'SHHH' you remind me.

Now I feel at once excited, curious, and nervous, as if a delicate spell has been cast which might be broken at the slightest mispronunciation.

I breathe deeply and attend to each step on the way to the hall. even tiptoeing superstitiously at the old creaky boards we replaced two years ago to avoid rousing an absent child. 

I brush, piss, floss and rinse with excessive care. 
And when I emerge you're sitting there, legs crossed eyes closed on a circular cushion.
There's an empty cushion opposite you.
My first instinct is to approach and embrace you, but I'm beginning to understand.
I start to situate myself on the empty cushion, you open one eye and request, matter of factly, 'Take your clothes off.'
I see you're not wearing any underwear beneath your gown.
My heart leaps, and I comply slowly to dampen my excitement.

I close my eyes and we sit for a moment.
You turn on a guided meditation, a simple body scan.
I intend to purge myself of anticipation and immerse myself in sensation.
In the moments when I am successful, I have never felt it more pleasant to be me.
I note my forehead: rough, the tip of my nose: somewhat cold, the tang of dry, summer air in my nose and throat flowing etherially over my exposed skin.
The individual hairs on my chest against the morning draft, I imagine the molecules exchanging energies like brief couplings along a temperature gradient.
My stomach driving my breath.
My pelvis and floor muscles an erect, earnest, loving, desiring penis.
I dwelt on that and checked back in at the toes and leathery soles of my feet.

A gentle chime hanging in the thin air.
I am not moving until I am told.
I continue the cadence of my breath, concenrating on the interplay between my pelvic muscles and my throbbing member.
I hear your soft footsteps approaching, you gently reach out and caress my penis rubbing it all over with oil.
I let out the gentlest of passionate sighs.

You rise and stand over me.
I haven't opened my eyes, your gown brushes against my nose.
I can smell your labia inches from my face and I long to taste you.
I breathe deeply and savor you.
My soul exclaims 'What a wonderful thing is the world!'

You put your hands on my shoulders and lower yourself into my lap.
Clasp your legs behind me, your delicate heels kneading my lower back.
Nose to nose we breathe each other.
You reach down, grab me, and direct me inside of you.
You lower yourself onto me completely and at the hilt our mouths open and gasp letting out deep contented sighs.

I put my hands up your dress on your back and let you press us together with your hands and legs.
Your hands on the back of my head, then my back, now running your nails over my upper back.

I lift your gown in request reaching up your back to knead the muscles of your upper back and neck.
You comply and raise it over your head without breaking the regular, hypnotic rhythm of your hips like a mantra.
You press me tightly to you, and I feel the sublime, electric sensation of your bare chest on mine.

We rock in ecstasy with no notion of time, and then you thrust yourself deeper onto me and hold yourself there.  
You move your face next to mine, resting your chin on my shoulder, pressing your breasts, chin, stomach onto me.
And you move yourself around me, in short, slow, grinding rhythms, and every sensation I feel is wonderful.

I feel the muscles of your vaginal wall caress my penis.
Our heavier breath syncs up.
Your breath on my neck tickles me, and you turn to suck on my earlobe.
I let loose an involuntary sigh and shudder joyfully.
I whisper your name into your ear, 'Oh Amanda'.
It is my prayer of gratitude to the universe that set me on my rambling path to you.

Your heart beats faster and your fingers clench the back of my head and neck.
I feel your lovely strength.
Your quickened breath on the nape of my neck.
I breathe deeply and calm my ecstatic brain stem.
I restrain my animal nature and choose, focusing on my breath while feeling, joyfully, the spasm through your body, the irregular kneading of your vagina.
A gasp, a moment of quiet, slow, liquid movement and you begin, 'Did you...'

But it's my turn this time, 'SHHHH'. 
And I push myself further into you and press your body against mine fervently.
I want to annihilate the last nanometer between our molecules.
To meld and make our bodies like our spirits.

You push out; I don't resist, and you put your nose on mine.
I blink and see your eyes are open; I open mine too.
You grind deeply onto me, your excited breath is like a runner's, ragged but regular.
We focus our gaze on each other's left eye, and I lose myself completely in love and you.
And we rock a rhythm growing slowly faster more intense.

I don't know where I end and you begin and in that connection, I feel no need to strive or cling or fear transition.
I let go into physical and spiritual ecstasy together with you.
Your body asks for what I can give, for what I am meant to give you.
And so we emerge from our orgasms, our now middle aged, ordinary faces inches from each other.
I see your whole face again and let out a chuckle.
You make a goofy face and we laugh hysterically.
We fall over the pillow, you on top of me.
Still connected laughing, laughing, laughing at our lives and our luck.
