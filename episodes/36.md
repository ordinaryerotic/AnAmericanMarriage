# 36

Another stressful night.
Another stressful day.
Where once there was light, the end of our tunnel has dimmed and our future appears uncertain.
An up and down spring has bled into a mostly down lost summer.
Our extra leisure shows me the distance between us more keenly and all my asnine attempts to engage seem to exacerbate the issue.

You've put on weight, but I've never been more attracted to you.
Or I'm as attracted to you as I've ever been.
I feel like you've claimed the essence of what I want, physically, in a mate.
When you change, my ideal changes.
You're the Cesium atom of my heart, _le grand dame A_.

I can't help it.
I'm in love with my wife.
As the distance between us grows and the repairs our marriage requires overwhelm us, I'm in love with my wife.
As fundamental as my breath, I'm in love with my wife.

I feel as similar way as I did this March when the virus drove us suddenly from the commons.
There was an unimaginable state, and, slowly, it's potential emerged until, like being pulled out to sea by a sly current, you turn to find your inevitable new condition.

Far fetched as it once was, and depite my unabated, elemental, chaotic desire for you; I have begun to plausibly imagine myself with other women.
I'm not too excited by the prospect, yet.
But, like the helpless bather, I am obliged to find my horror tinged with curiosity.

I don't know what to do and much of the time I just freeze.
I haven't seen a passionate signal from you in months (years?).
I don't know, but somehow I can sense that now, we both believe a lot more in bolts from the blue.

*****

Hayley's in preschool half-day now and I switched my schedule for half-day Fridays.
You don't seem to mind me coming home a bit later weekdays, my absence hardly bothers you.
The first day I was home Friday afternoon, you went to Smith's just before I got home and stayed there four hours after Hayley's after school nap.
How could I avoid feeling avoided.
And we avoided that in counseling too thanks to a convenient frustrated outburst of mine Sunday.
It feels almost designed.
The narcissism of small differences masking a widening chasm.
Mismatched furniture to draw attention from bowed floorboards.

I'm at home in the guest room at 9:30 and you're pissed.
You got Hayley ready and pushed her out the door without noticing and now you're taking Pippi outside and jarringly stumble upon me reading a novel on the bed.

You jump back but don't laugh like you used to.
You face turns almost to a grimace and with an edge you ask 'Aren't you going to work?'
Those rhetorical questions always serve to raise the hairs on the back of my neck.
'EXPLAIN YOURSELF!' is what I hear.

Gritted teeth, 'I told you three times.  This week, I"m working my half day in the afternoon.'
I'm needling you subconsciously, it was only twice.

You're gripped by an unpleasant feeling, you planned to avoid me with Smith's again, but now you don't have a list or any concrete plans and feel trapped by my oppressive existence.
My misasmal aura.
Sitting there reading, still only on the third chapter of the second book of 'Demons'.

'Hmm', you grunt and open the door.
'Can you let Luna back in in a minute.  I'm going to take a shower.'
A long one I'm sure.
'When are you leaving?'

'Noon.'

You're already in the kitchen.
I sigh and put on headphones.
I turn it up to 11 and still hear Pippi barking like she needs an exorcism while I let her go like a sociopath and browse flights for a conference in Indianapolis.
Half an hour later you stomp in in a towel and one over your hair.
I finally outlasted your patience.
You look phenomenal.

'Where's Luna?', demanding.

'Outside, where else', insouciant.

'I asked you to bring her back in.'
No shit.

'Hmm,' I turn from my screen and lower my headphone volume.

I face you propping myself up on my elbows.
Puffing out my chest just a little.
I can tell you can tell that I've been doing pushups.
This time I haven't told you about it; I wonder if you wonder.

You stand there with that openmouthed, angry, condescending expression I"ve seen at least once a month for the past three years.
This time I'm over it.
I cock my head to the side; I'm prepared to wait expressionless if it takes all week.
I can tell you're about to say something mean that ends in my name on a contemptuous note.
But you see I'm over it so you just grunt and storm off.
I can't fake it.
I feel very little.

Half an hour later, I go to piss.
Our door is closed.
I have to get my work clothes in there.
You're sitting cutting your hair with headphones on.
Panties and a loose fitting shirt.
I'm not looking at you.
I throw on a tank, grab a button down, socks, and jeans and move to go.

'Hey, you let Pippi out.
She's barking again.
You push past me and call down the hall.
I move to brush past you, in the door way.but you're blocking me with your arm on the jamb.

'Excuse me,' deadpan.

You turn and notice me for a second.
The mask slips momentarily, and I know you're attracted to me despite how much your distaste.

I knock your arm out of the way and you cry out like a footballer.
I'm almost out of the hallway when you call out, 'What the fuck do you want from me!'

I turn.
I can't believe you haven't shut the door.
It doesn't look like you're going to.
'Passion. Like a wife who gives a shit about our marriage.'
You're still there, weird.
'A relationship worth having. To feel loved and wanted.'
I'm animated and gesticulating.
'Someone who wants to fuck my brains out, who'd take that opportunity on a Friday with fuck-all else to do. A wife who seems even remotely alive.
A blowjob.
Makeup sex.
Kissing for fucksake.
The girl I met at midnight at a bar across an ocean, not this dead eyed sober sexless schoolmarm I'm married to.'

You're stunned.
I hadn't been that harsh before.
But now, I just blew up a load bearing column; I checked out, you appraised it for a second.
I had nothing to lose and really, neither did you.
You're very predictable except when you aren't, and I was sure you were about to close the door silently.

I was mentally tallying legal fees, arms akimbo, staring through you when you swallowed some pride, strode up to me right under my chin, looked up calmly like a fighter at weigh in, thrust your hand down my pants, grabbed my already hard dick tightly, led me to the bedroom and pushed me on the bed.

You put your hands on my chest, climbed on top of me and straddled me, your butt resting on my stomach.
You grabbed my hands and pinned them above my head with no resistance.
I'm just going with it, more curious than surprised.

You hover over me.
Neutrally, 'Don't look right in my eyes.'
I look at the top of your head.
'I bore you a child. I gave up my job. I moved away from my friends. I married you.'
You slap me gently on the cheek.
'Mmm hmm,' I hum assent.
You pull your shirt off.

You grab my cheeks and kiss me.
You throw your tongue in my mouth and I slip into yours and I'm lost.
I forget every pet peeve, missed deadline, task list, recurring argument, and transgression I swore I would remember the next time I needed ammo.
As quick as the jolt on the ascent of a roller coaster, I love and I've always loved and vibrate in the fervor of boundless gratitude.
I try to make a move, but meet immediate resistance.
You pin me with your legs, hands and mouth.
Your breasts brush my upper chest.

It's wonderful.
You suddenly get up.
I am not naive enough to protest too quickly.
'Take your clothes off and lie over there.'
You gesture to the head of the bed.
'I'll be right back.'

I do as you say and lie flat and nude in the center of the bed.
The first cool air of autumn drifts over my body kindly from the half open window.
I breathe deeply and close my eyes.
You come in and I don't move.
You put the sleep mask on me, rub my chest softly, and straddle me like you did before.
I can feel you're naked, a delicate moisture on my upper chest.
I can smell you're naked, there's nothing like you.
You rub my chest up my neck to my temples and scratch my scalp before breathing deeply.
'Are you ready to do exactly what I tell you.'

'Yes.'

You move up my chest, drawing my arms at my sides to perpendicular with your knees.
You move your knees over my arms near my shoulders and gather up my hands and hold them against your stomach just under your breasts.
Your ineffable labia hung centimeters from my mouth and nose, an oasis in the Sahara.
You pause for what seems like a minute or two.
I resolved not to make a move until you tell me, and I'm stewing, joyfully in my hunger.
'Lay your tongue
